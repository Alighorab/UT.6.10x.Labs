### Description
- This lab has these major objectives: 
    1) the understanding and implementing of indexed data structures;
    2) learning how to create a segmented software system; and
    3) the study of real-time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller.

- Software skills you will learn include `advanced indexed addressing`, 
`linked data structures`, `creating fixed-time delays using the SysTick timer`, 
and `debugging real-time systems`.

### Preparation
- You will need a `LaunchPad`, a `three switches`, `three 10kΩ resistors`, 
`six LEDs`, and `six 470Ω resistors`.

### A Working Lab 10
